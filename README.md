# Fashion-MNIST-with-CNN

This is an exercise of implementing and comparing several machine learning algorithms, including a Multi layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), on an image classification task.

The dataset (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is Fashion-MNIST, including images in the same 28x28 greyscale format as the original MNIST dataset. Each image depicts an item of clothing or fashion accessory, with ten classes in total.
